# Colorific

Swift: This app was mainly used as a test app to hit different spots where the app broke and I needed to learn how to debug the error properly

I'm going to write some tips for success here for things you can do when you get an error when developing.

1: You're not alone!
  - App building is all about problem solving which means we solve problems along the way and everyone else who builds apps does the same thing which means there's a place out there in the internet where we collectively help eachother out.
  - The big tip here is. Take whatever error you receive from xcode and type it into google. I recommend adding "ios" right in front of the error.
  - FOR INSTANCE: you get an error when declaring that you will adhere to the UITableViewDelegate and UITableViewDataSource that reads... "type viewcontroller does not conform to the protocol uitableviewdatasource"
  - Go to google.com and enter: "ios type viewcontroller does not conform to the protocol uitableviewdatasource"
  - MANY MANY TIMES the 1st or 2nd result will link you to stackoverflow.com. 
  - StackOverflow is our place where we come together to ask/answer developer questions. Look for answers there and if you don't find an answer to your problem, ask a question. People respond to your questions pretty quickly and most times will either include a link to someone asking the question before you with a good answer provided or they will answer it themselves for you. StackOverflow will always comes in handy. Don't forget it.
